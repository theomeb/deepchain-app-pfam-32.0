# Description
**Pfam32.0 classifier.** :dna: :test_tube: :mag:

This is a **DeepChain app** to predict the _protein family id_ out of a given sequence.

For extensive details, check the [deepchain-app-pfam-32.0](https://github.com/theomeb/deepchain-app-pfam-32.0) github repo. :nerd_face:

## Data
- This app has been trained with the _pfam32.0_ dataset available with the [bio-datasets](https://pypi.org/project/bio-datasets) API:
```python
# Load pfam dataset
pfam_dataset = load_dataset("pfam-32.0", force=True)
_, y = pfam_dataset.to_npy_arrays(input_names=["sequence"], target_names=["family_id"])
```

- This dataset contains roughly 1339k protein sequences for which the following features are available:
  - _sequence_ - raw sequence **feature**
  - _sequence_name_ - name of the sequence
  - _split_ - original train/dev/test split
  - _family_id_ - **target**
  - _family_accession_ - associated to _family_id_
  
- There are **17929 unique families**, for which only 13071 are present in all splits.
  
- For the _sequence_ feature, corresponding [ProtBert](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans) (_pooling: mean_) embeddings have been computed. For compute reasons, only the embeddings for the first 200 000 sequences are available. The rest will follow very soon.
- This app used [bio-transformers](https://pypi.org/project/bio-transformers/) to compute these embeddings.

- The original dataset can be found here: [Pfam32.0](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam32.0/Pfam-A.seed.gz), or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/googleai/pfam-seed-random-split).

## Model

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theomeb/deepchain-app-pfam-32.0/develop/src/architecture.png)

- The classifier takes as input the sequence embeddings (_1024-dim_ vector) and then uses a Dense multi-classification to predict the _protein family id_. The model architecture can be found below:

```python
FamilyMLP(
  (_model): Sequential(
    (0): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=256, bias=True)
    (1): ReLU()
    (2): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
    (3): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=256, bias=True)
    (4): ReLU()
    (5): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
    (6): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=num_classes, bias=True)
  )
)
```

- For training, we used the already given train/val split and we filtered out training samples for which their classes were not present in the dev split set. We have 13071 final family ids.
- The model has been trained on a P100 GPU for 20 epochs and reached an accuracy of 87%. 
- In the future, we will reach to a better accuracy with improvements such as:
    - Higher model capacity
    - Weighted loss to account for rare classes
    - Better and longer training strategy

This app is mean to be deployed in deepchain.bio and has been implemented thanks to the following libraries:
- The main [deepchain-apps](https://pypi.org/project/deepchain-apps/) package - can be found on pypi.
- The [bio-transformers](https://pypi.org/project/bio-transformers/) package.
- The [bio-datasets](https://pypi.org/project/bio-datasets) package.

## Examples

_compute_scores()_ returns a dictionary for each sequence with the predicted _protein_family_id_.


```python
[
  {
    'protein_family_id': 'PuR_N'
  },
   {
    'protein_family_id':'Rrf2'
  }
]
```
